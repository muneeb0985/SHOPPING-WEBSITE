Hello everyone! This is me, Syed Muneeb Ahmed. I have created a shopping website using React, with an exciting and user-friendly UI. The application includes sign-in and login functionality, authenticated through Auth0.

This project is built using React Routing for seamless navigation across different pages and Redux for efficient state management.

The website offers several exciting features, including:

New Arrivals

Trending Products

Top Selling Items

Navigation links like Home, Shop, Collection, About, and Contact

Auth0 Authentication

Product Filtering based on categories

Additionally, I have integrated a Contact Us page with Firebase, which allows users to send messages through a contact form â€” these messages are stored directly in Firebase.

Other features include:

Product Detail View (Clicking the eye icon shows detailed information)

Add to Cart and Remove from Cart functionality

Increment/Decrement the number of selected products

Subtotal and Total Price Calculation based on cart quantity

This project showcases my skills in React, routing, Redux, Firebase integration, and user authentication using Auth0.
